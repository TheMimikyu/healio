#  Healio  	: `One Stop Solution to Healthcare Needs`
Thought of as a **Website** while having room for always **Growth**.
## Objective
To Empower Patients and Medical Professionals alike by simple integration of Medicinal Habit Tracker, Diet Tracker by shared data among both sides.

## Methodology
Many Patients throughout the world are late on taking their medications. A notable problem of taking **Scheduled Medications** is delay in taking or missing medicine. This has an adverse effect on patient's recovery. 
However, all these Delays must be communicated to the **Medical Professionals**. For if they know these **Medical Observations** at the right time in the right way then Patients can be helped in their recovery.
###

Another Aspect of Proper Recovery is **Proper Diet**. A Similar Diet **Tracker**, Calorie Management is required. This Data can be beneficial in recovery of many patients.

However, for it to be truly relevant to Medical Professionals, A Prescription System Should be there, say a Prescription Template. That would help produce digital Prescription which will automatically **Schedule Medication** for the Patient.
